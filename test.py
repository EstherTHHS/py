#language 1)Syntax=grammar can see  2)semantics=how working  behind the scence ,runtime behavior 3)pragmatics =efficiently use language construction , short to the point and efficiency and write usage also design 
# Complier->C++=>intermediate code to native code
# Get source code->transfer intermediate  code ->transfom that intermediate code to native code

# Interpreter
# source code ->produce the whole program as a byte code (in memory)->directly execute byte code line by line

# intermediate code is non directly executable but 
# byte code is not run in native code butcan be executed on  VM or interperter.
